Seeking@CMU
My term project is a Tinder-like dating app specifically aimed towards CMU students. Users will be able to create a profile, and a sorting algorithm will bring the most potential matches to the front of the user’s feed so they can either “like” them or not. Matches will be made if two users like each other. Supermatches are made if users are found to be exceptionally compatible. If matches are made, users are set up on a date based on their inputted schedules. Users can also send direct messages to each other. 


How to run:
Open the zip file into a folder. Open a terminal window, and navigate to the folder where the files are stored. Run the file “profile_server.py”. Once that is running, open one or more terminal windows, navigate to the same folder, and run the file “profile_client.py”. You should now have the login page up and ready to use.
